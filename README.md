# Samurai Shodown: X-Mat Studio

We are a development team with great enthusiasm for the sector. We define passion and teamwork, we do not leave anyone behind or leave the burden of their work on their peers. We intend to exceed expectations and feel fulfilled by our own work. We invite you to take a look at this project, in this case, to all the research we have done behind this fabulous game: Samurai Shodown.

Today we are in the stage of development exclusively of the Wiki and compilation of all the necessary documentation to start developing an emulation of Samurai Shodown.
